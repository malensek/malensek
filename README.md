### Hello! ☕️

I'm an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of San Francisco. I teach things like <a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/cs677/">Big Data</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/cs326/">Operating Systems</a>. I love systems programming, especially distributed systems.

Have a great day!
